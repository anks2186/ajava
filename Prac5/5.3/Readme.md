Java Server Pages (JSP)
=======================

5.3 Retrieving the data posted to a JSP file from HTML file
-----------------------------------------------------------
Consider an html page that prompts the user to enter his/her name, let's call it getname.htm. 
The target of form is "showname.jsp", which displays the name entered by the user. To retrieve the value entered by the user we uses the request.getParameter("username"); code.
